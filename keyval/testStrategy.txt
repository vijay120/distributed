We were short on time (and just trying to meet the deadline), so our testing was
on an ad-hoc basis as we went. We had split the implementation duties
roughly along the lines of rebalancing the nodes and implementing
the key-value insertion/lookup/snapshot functionality. Therefore,
we each tested them in turn as we went, and then made sure they
worked in tandem via ssh'ing into a number of machine and
making sure the process worked correctly.

(For example, by adding new nodes, sending messages
from the outside world to insert, leave, etc.)
